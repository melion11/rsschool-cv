## _About me_
	I'm 24 years old. i work as engineer in The National Academy of Sciences. At the moment I am looking for myself and my life's work in which I will successfully develop. All my life I've been interested in learning something related to the computer. At the age of 10, I made websites on the free UCOZ platform, then I abandoned it (more precisely, my parents helped me) because of unsatisfactory academic performance at school. Now I'm here to fix it and become a successful Frontend developer.
